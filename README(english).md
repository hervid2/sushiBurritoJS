‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup
To get the project up and running, you will need to clone this repository and set up both the backend and the frontend separately.

Prerequisites
Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended)

NPM (usually installed with Node.js)

A running MySQL database server.

1. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder:

cd backend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Set up environment variables:

Create a copy of the .env.example file and rename it to .env.

Open the .env file and fill in all the variables with your credentials:

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=sushi_burrito_db

# Secrets for JSON Web Token (generate random and secure strings)
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_super_secret_for_access_token
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_other_super_secret_for_refresh_token
TOKEN_EXPIRATION=1h
REFRESH_EXPIRATION=7d

# Configuration for sending emails (e.g., with Gmail)
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password

Create the database: Make sure to create a database in MySQL with the name you specified in DB_NAME.

Seed the database with initial data:

The src/seed.js file is set up to create the default roles and an administrator user.

Run the following command:

npm run db:seed

This will insert the roles and the first administrator user so you can log in.

2. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:

cd frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application
You should have two terminals open, one for the backend and one for the frontend.

Start the Backend Server:

In the backend folder terminal, run:

npm run dev

The server will start on http://localhost:3000.

Start the Frontend Application:

In the frontend folder terminal, run:

npm run dev

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173.

Now you can open http://localhost:5173 in your browser and start using the application!
